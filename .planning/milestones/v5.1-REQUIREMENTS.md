## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Native mobile apps | PWA provides mobile experience; native apps add significant complexity |
| Live betting streams | Requires complex licensing; not core to arbitrage value |
| Real payment processing | Mock Stripe sufficient for demo; production requires PCI compliance |
| Multi-tenant architecture | Single-tenant sufficient for current scale |
| Advanced AI models | Current inverse probability model sufficient; GPT integration adds cost |

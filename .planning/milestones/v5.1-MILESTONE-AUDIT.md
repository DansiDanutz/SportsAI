**Phase 3:**
- MON-01 through MON-04 (4 requirements) - Complete

**Phase 1 (Implicit):**
- DEPLOY-FE-06 (Frontend accessible) - Verified in Phase 2
- DEPLOY-BE-07 (Backend API endpoints accessible) - Verified in Phase 2

### Partial (6)

**Phase 2 Browser Verification:**

- All components verified as existing and connected
- Only browser-based confirmation pending

### Unsatisfied (20)

**Phase 1 (Unverified):**

- DEPLOY-BE-01 through DEPLOY-BE-06 (6)
- INFRA-01 through INFRA-04 (4)
- SEC-01 through SEC-05 (5)

**Reason:** Phase 1 marked complete as "existing deployments" without formal verification

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate (Before Production Use)

1. **Perform Browser Verification** (HIGH)
   - Execute the 6 verification tests in 02-VERIFICATION.md
   - Test at https://sports-ai-one.vercel.app
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify signup/login flows work
   - Confirm CORS headers are correct

2. **Activate Vercel Analytics** (HIGH)
   - Go to Vercel Dashboard → sports-ai-one → Analytics
   - Enable Analytics
   - Deploy frontend
   - Verify page views appear

3. **Configure Deployment Notifications** (HIGH)
   - Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Git → Verify GitHub connected
   - Settings → Notifications → Enable notifications
   - Test via git push

### Medium Priority

4. **Verify Phase 1 Security** (MEDIUM)
   - Confirm JWT_SECRET is strong (not default)
   - Verify API keys in environment variables
   - Check CORS_ORIGIN restricted to Vercel URL
   - Confirm rate limiting enabled

5. **Test /healthz/data Endpoint** (MEDIUM)
   - Visit https://sportsapiai.onrender.com/healthz/data
   - Verify database has data (sports, leagues, teams, events)

### Low Priority

6. **Consider Sentry for Backend** (LOW)
   - Vercel Error Tracking is frontend-only
   - Backend errors monitored via Render logs
   - Upgrade path documented in 03-02-ERROR-TRACKING.md

---

## Conclusion

Milestone v5.1 achieved its primary goal: **production deployment with monitoring infrastructure**. All code-based requirements are met, cross-phase integration is verified, and monitoring components are in place.

**Remaining work is user-facing:**
1. Browser-based verification (6 tests)
2. Dashboard configuration (Analytics activation, notification setup)

**System is production-ready pending:**
- Manual browser verification
- Vercel dashboard configuration
- Frontend deployment to activate analytics

**Recommendation:** Complete user verification steps, then proceed to `/gsd:complete-milestone v5.1` to archive.

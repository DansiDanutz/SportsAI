  <name>Task 1: Verify Frontend Homepage Load</name>
  <action>No automated action - this is a verification checkpoint</action>
  <verify>
    Manual browser testing:

    1. Open browser and navigate to: https://sports-ai-one.vercel.app
    2. Open Developer Tools (F12) and go to Console tab
    3. Check the Network tab for the page load
    4. Verify the following:
       - Page loads successfully (not a blank screen or error)
       - No red console errors (warnings are acceptable)
       - Page title is "SportsAI - Smart Sports Intelligence Platform" or similar
       - Basic UI elements are visible (header, navigation, content area)
       - Page is responsive (try resizing browser window)

    5. Document findings:
       - Load time (from Network tab timing)
       - Any console errors (copy exact error messages)
       - Any console warnings (note if they seem problematic)
       - Visual appearance (screenshot description)
       - Any obvious broken functionality
  </verify>

    Verification complete with:
    - Page load status (success/failed/partial)
    - Console error count and details
    - Load time measurement
    - Visual UI state description
    - Any issues requiring fixes in subsequent plans

    ## Load Test Results

    ### Page Load Status
    - Status: [SUCCESS/FAILED/PARTIAL]
    - Load Time: [X seconds]
    - Page Title: [Actual page title]

    ### Console Status
    - Errors: [X errors found]
    - Warnings: [X warnings found]

    ### Errors Found
    [List any errors with full details, or "None"]

    ### Warnings Found

After completion:
- Frontend URL is accessible and loads
- SUMMARY.md contains detailed verification results
- Any critical issues are documented for follow-up
</verification>

<success_criteria>
1. Frontend homepage loads at deployed URL
2. No critical console errors that prevent UI rendering
3. Verification results documented in SUMMARY.md
4. Any issues identified are clearly described
